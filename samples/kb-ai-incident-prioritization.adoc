== Overview

This article explains how to configure AI-based prioritization for Security Incident Response (SIR) in ServiceNow. By enabling predictive models, security teams can triage incidents faster and more accurately.

== Prerequisites

- ServiceNow SecOps plugin
- Access to Predictive Intelligence module
- Admin or SecOps Admin role

== Steps to Enable AI Prioritization

. Navigate to *Predictive Intelligence > Models*.
. Select **Incident Priority Prediction** model.
. Configure training data set from past incidents.
. Activate the model and validate accuracy (recommended: 80%+).
. Map model outputs to incident priority scale (1â€“5).
. Deploy changes and test in a sandbox environment.

== Example Use Case

An incident with similar characteristics to past 'Critical' events will automatically be assigned a Priority 1 and escalated to Tier 2 support with no manual intervention.

== Troubleshooting

- If accuracy is low, retrain the model with a larger dataset.
- Check if field mappings are correct in the Incident table.
