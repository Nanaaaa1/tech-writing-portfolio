# Why Editorial Standards Matter in AI-Driven Documentation

In the rush to publish technical documentation for AI-enabled platforms, quality often takes a back seat to speed. But in an environment where precision, clarity, and trust are critical, editorial review processes are more important than ever.

## The Challenge with AI Docs

AI features evolve quickly. Documentation written today may be obsolete in a week. Writers are also challenged to explain how AI models work without misleading or overpromising their capabilities.

## The Role of Editorial Review

Editorial review helps ensure:
- Terminology remains consistent across documents.
- Unintentional bias or misleading AI claims are removed.
- The tone aligns with organizational branding and user trust.

## Before and After Example

**Before:**  
> "Our AI will solve your security problems automatically."

**After:**  
> "Our AI helps prioritize security incidents based on historical trends, allowing teams to focus on the most critical threats."

## Our Editorial Checklist
- ✅ Use plain language
- ✅ Avoid overuse of passive voice
- ✅ Explain acronyms on first use
- ✅ Ensure AI functionality is described factually
- ✅ Confirm diagrams match descriptions

## Conclusion

Editorial excellence is not a luxury—it's a requirement for high-quality AI documentation. As AI transforms how users interact with products, writers must adapt their standards to keep pace.
