== Overview

This repository contains real-world technical documentation examples modeled after tasks performed in a production support environment. All examples are written in AsciiDoc format using a Docs-as-Code workflow to reflect industry-standard authoring.

== Key Use Cases

* FedEx application support using SuperPuTTY/SSH
* Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline documentation
* Error log inspection, triage, and incident response
* System service restart procedures
* UPS testing for internal tools (ISS)
* Application checkout & log validation steps

== Docs-as-Code Stack

* AsciiDoc for structured technical writing
* Git for version control
* Structured in folders by use case (logs, service, test, etc.)
